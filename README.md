#  Project Title: ph519p-pgp-2-repo
This repository cantains all the code for simulation program that have been part of my academic course work (PH-519P).

# Decription
This repository cantains Fortran code for Numerical Simulation of different Quantum System, for each Quantum system a seperate branch is made which would not be merged. Whereas main branch will cantain the code scattering of electron 

## Updates
This repository is under work and code is not yet complete but you are free to check out the code.
